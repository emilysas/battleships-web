#Battleships
_____________________

This was the project for Week 3 of Makers Academy. The task was to take the programme we'd written for the command line and create a server in sinatra such that it could be played online.

##Pair Partner
I paired with [Andy Newman](https://github.com/andygnewman)

##Tools Used
* Ruby
* Sinatra
* Rspec
* Cucumber
* Capybara

##Lessons Learned
This learning objectives for this project were to introduce us to the Sinatra framework, and to BDD (Cucumber and Capybara).


## Domain Model / CRC

For the sake of simplicity, and in order to concentrate on learning Sinatra, we used the [code](https://github.com/stephenlloyd/battle_ships_september) written by [Stephen Lloyd](https://github.com/stephenlloyd)

##Issues faced

We did not make as much progress with the project as we would have liked as we spent some time trying to wrap our heads around how to deal with the persistence of objects in sessions without using databases.

##Future Intentions

I would like to complete the project, and will probably include the use of a database.
